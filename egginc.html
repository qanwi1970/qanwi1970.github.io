        <h1>Egg Inc. Calculators</h1>
        <p>I really like this game. Sometimes you need math to know if a goal is achievable, and here's some calculators
            to help you decide if you should keep grinding or prestige for the soul eggs and come back.

        <h2>Can I make the next egg?</h2>
        <p>The value of your farm scales linearly with the number of chickens. However, the line doesn't start at 0, as
            the value of your farm's assets (habitats, transports) affects the value at the point of 0 chickens. This is
            going to take algebra, but don't worry, I got your back.
        </p>
        <p>First, I need to take a screen shot of your farm with the next goal up, like this:</p>
